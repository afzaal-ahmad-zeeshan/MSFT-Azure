# MSFT-Azure
This repository would be used to add and share the scripts that can be helpful in automating most of your stuff, relative to Microsoft Azure. I primarily use Linux environment for most of my .NET Core programming and that is exactly why you will find most of my scripts, tooling and project samples based on Linux -- but that doesn't make any difference since they are all .NET Core-oriented. I will try to keep the repository maintained and clean. 

As I upload and share more scripts and categories, I will update the readme file. 

**Disclaimer:** This repository is not affiliated with Microsoft or Microsoft Azure, it is just my own repository for sharing the scripts and toolings for Microsoft Azure users for various purposes.
